# My First SQL Project

This is my very first SQL project. I made a database for a classroom that keeps track of students.  
It has things like their name, their fatherâ€™s name, roll number, when they joined, their phone number, and whether they paid fees or not.  

I added 15 sample students into it so I could practice.  
Nothing fancy, just me learning how to create a database and insert data.  

The file here is `classroom_database.sq.sql`. You can run it in SQL Server or any SQL tool and it will make the database called **ClassroomDB** with a table called **Students**.  

Iâ€™m still new to SQL, so this is just the start. ðŸ™‚
